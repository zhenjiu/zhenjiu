### MPH Epidemiology Researcher | Biomimicry Problem Solver | Integrative Medicine Clinician

I am an MPH–Epidemiology researcher working at the intersection of **quantitative methods**, **ecological systems thinking**, and **population health**. My current work centers on NSCH 2022–2023 analyses investigating whether **adequate sleep modifies the association between adverse childhood experiences and chronic or recurrent pain** in U.S. children.

My background spans:

- **Epidemiology & Data Analysis** — R, SAS, SPSS, complex survey methods, reproducible workflows  
- **Biomimicry Research** — applying ecological and evolutionary principles to problem solving and system design  
- **Integrative Medicine** — 10+ years of clinical experience in complex pain and chronic disease management
